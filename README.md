## Deployment

See the [AWS Deployment Guide](aws-deployment/README.md) for detailed instructions on deploying to AWS.

## Testing the Platform

### Simulating Events

You can use the simulation endpoint to generate test events:

\`\`\`bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/simulate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"count": 100}'
\`\`\`

This will generate 100 random events of various types.

### Sending Custom Events

You can also send custom events:

\`\`\`bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/events -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "eventType": "product_view",
  "userId": "user_123",
  "sessionId": "session_456",
  "data": {
    "productId": "prod_789",
    "productName": "Wireless Headphones",
    "price": 99.99,
    "category": "Electronics"
  }
}'

## Understanding the Project

Let me explain the key components of this e-commerce analytics platform:

### 1. Event Collector Service

This service is responsible for collecting user events from your e-commerce website. It:
- Provides REST endpoints to receive events
- Validates incoming events
- Sends events to Kafka for processing
- Includes a simulation endpoint for testing

The event collector acts as the entry point for all user behavior data. It's designed to be lightweight and fast, simply validating and forwarding events to Kafka.

### 2. Data Processor Service

This service consumes events from Kafka, processes them, and stores results in MongoDB. It:
- Processes different event types (page views, product views, cart actions, etc.)
- Calculates metrics like conversion rates
- Updates real-time metrics
- Stores  cart actions, etc.)
- Calculates metrics like conversion rates
- Updates real-time metrics
- Stores processed data in MongoDB collections for analytics
- Sends real-time metrics back to Kafka for dashboard updates

The data processor is the heart of the analytics platform, transforming raw events into meaningful insights. It's designed to be scalable and can be horizontally scaled by adding more instances.

### 3. API Server

This service provides REST endpoints for the frontend to fetch analytics data. It:
- Connects to MongoDB to retrieve processed data
- Provides endpoints for different types of analytics (dashboard, products, users, sales)
- Formats data for easy consumption by the frontend
- Subscribes to Kafka for real-time updates

The API server acts as the bridge between the processed data and the frontend dashboard. It's optimized for query performance and designed to handle multiple concurrent requests.

### 4. React Frontend

The frontend is a responsive React application that visualizes the analytics data. It:
- Displays real-time metrics and trends
- Provides interactive charts and graphs
- Offers filtering and sorting capabilities
- Updates automatically as new data comes in

The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and informative, giving e-commerce managers the insights they need to make data-driven decisions.

## AWS Deployment Strategy

For deploying to AWS, we're using a combination of services:

1. **EC2 instances** for the Node.js services
   - Each service runs on its own instance for isolation and scalability
   - Instances are configured with security groups to control access

2. **MongoDB Atlas** for the database
   - Managed MongoDB service with automatic scaling and backups
   - Secure connection with proper authentication

3. **Amazon MSK** for Kafka
   - Managed Kafka service that handles the complexity of running Kafka
   - Configured with proper security and replication

4. **S3 and CloudFront** for the frontend
   - Static assets hosted on S3 for cost-effectiveness
   - CloudFront for global distribution and caching

5. **Elastic Load Balancer** for the API
   - Distributes traffic across multiple API server instances
   - Handles SSL termination and health checks

This architecture is designed to be scalable, resilient, and cost-effective. You can start with minimal resources and scale up as your traffic grows.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Once deployed, you'll want to set up:

1. **CloudWatch Alarms** for monitoring resource utilization
2. **CloudWatch Logs** for centralized logging
3. **AWS X-Ray** for distributed tracing (optional)
4. **Regular backups** of your MongoDB data

## Next Steps

After deploying the basic platform, you might want to consider:

1. **Adding more event types** specific to your e-commerce business
2. **Implementing A/B testing** capabilities
3. **Integrating with recommendation engines**
4. **Setting up automated reports** via email
5. **Adding user authentication** to the dashboard

This platform provides a solid foundation that you can extend and customize based on your specific business needs.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the system in more detail?
